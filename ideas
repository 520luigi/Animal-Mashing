ideas for the game

-add a bar graph design, whoever hits buttons the fastest hits the top bar....
-add different colors (1-4 players (maybe))
-add sounds, graphic display of who won!
-add "welcome to button smasher yah! who will be the champion of this button smashing game! is it you? or You or YOU!!!"
-create something fun and everything else will follow, focus will follow, enjoyment of life will follow...


-get key pressed and held to not count... (cannot have held keys to count for the game loop)

-why do i even need to use bar graphs lol! Use fun images like animal portraits or sprite spaceships or something fun!
-need to work on
    *who won, let the message poop out who won!
    *add sounds per click, winners,
    #add a starting menu, graphics must look good (make one in photoshop!)...add start menu music that loops...

-best of 3 to see who the winner is..
-add count down of when to begin: perhaps use a time delay while the music sounds of 3, 2, 1, Begin... (and add visual image, then clear window...)
