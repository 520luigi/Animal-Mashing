This is a python game made with pygame for HackHighSchool, a high school program for students. As a mentor, I made a simple game for showcase. The point of the game is to mash buttons and see who is the fastest. There are two players. The left player uses the left shift key, and the right player uses the right shift key for control.

Big thanks to Xuan Zhu (xlz447) for helping with debugging, and photoshop skills. Also big thanks to kenney.nl for the free assets used in the game and free intro music used from:
