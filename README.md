# Animal-Mashing
This is a python game made with pygame for HackHighSchool, a high school program for students. As a mentor, I made a simple game for showcase. The point of the game is to mash buttons and see who is the fastest. There are two players. The left player uses the left shift key, and the right player uses the right shift key for control.
