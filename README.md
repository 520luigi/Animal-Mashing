This is a python game made with pygame for HackHighSchool, a high school program for students. As a mentor, I made a simple game for showcase. The point of the game is to mash buttons and see who is the fastest. There are two players. The left player uses the left shift key, and the right player uses the right shift key for control. Escape is used to exit the game screen during game intro or you can quit right away by clicking the top left corner 'x' for window exit. Enter is used to start the countdown timer for when the game starts!

Big thanks to Xuan Zhu (xlz447) for helping with debugging, and photoshop skills. Also big thanks to kenney.nl for the free assets used in the game and free intro music used from:

Run the commands to compile the game in the terminal. Make sure you have python and pygame.  
```
python game.py
```
