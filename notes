Ideas to improve the game:

1. Add a best of 3?
This is a  looping screen indicates the number of rounds out of 3!
--it also shows the control! player1 left shift; player2 right shift, how about taking the sounds 3,2,1 begin and put it in this new round loading screen!
--3 loops, and afterwards go straight push esc to main menu.

2. More than 2 players.
Make option for players to choose from number of players 2 to 4, or give 3 choices of 2, 3, or 4 players. Specify controls for these 4 players.

3. Control display visibility, tell players the control location.

4. find a way to use properly use pyinstaller so that I can add an icon to executable without adding an invis file. Also make it so that a console
   window doesn't open up when I click on executable. I tried modifying the spec file and using the command:
                pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=<icon absolute path>exe.icns Animal-Mashing.spec
        (But this doesn't work.....lol)
